# Weather App with Spring Boot

This document outlines a simple weather application built using Spring Boot. It retrieves current weather data based on user input (city name) from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the information dynamically.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Spring Boot can integrate with an external API to fetch and display weather information. It serves as a practical example of building a RESTful web service and working with a third-party API for data retrieval.

## Features

- **Weather Data Fetching**: Retrieves current weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, description) from OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Dynamic UI Update**: Uses JavaScript and AJAX to update the UI dynamically based on user input. (Optional - Frontend not included in this example)
- **RESTful API Endpoint**: Exposes a REST API endpoint to fetch weather data for a specific city.
- **External API Integration**: Integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating Java-based applications.
- **RESTful Web Services**: Design and implementation of REST APIs.
- **Thymeleaf (Optional)**: Template engine for server-side HTML rendering (if frontend is included).
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: External API used for fetching weather data.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Java
- OpenWeatherMap API
- JSON

## Features
- Integration with OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data.
- RESTful API endpoints for retrieving weather information.
- Utilization of Java for backend development and JSON for data exchange.
